# Stage 2 

- The priority of this stage is the planning documents.
- We are not expected to code at this stage
- [ ] Develop plans for how we will organise
- [ ] We need to think about the structure of the app - start working on the class diagram (possibly split it into models and the rest)
- [ ] We need to review the use case diagrams they gave us and correct them
- [ ] Decide what is the most important (ie what to tackle first)

## More (name of each document, describe processes involved, purpose of each document)

### Project management

- Meetings once a week (with notes summarising what was discussed)
- Agile (Scrum)
- Workshops
- Trello to split tasks during each sprint (?) 
- FaceBook to stay in touch / deal with issues
- For any documents to be completed by more than one person we can use Google Docs
- GANTT chart - do we really need it?

### QA

### Reviews

- During meetings

### Version Control

- Git(lab)
- Once we will agree on the class structure I will write + upload it

### Software Tests

- JUnit5 (API is essentially the same as JUnit4)
- I've already set everything up
- Bug tracking system on GitLab

## Scrum

- [ ] We need a Scrum Master
- [ ] We need a Product Owner
- [ ] We need to identify which features are the most important (prioritise)
- [ ] We need to plan the first iteration (sprint)
- [ ] We need a product backlog
- [ ] We need a sprint backlog for the first sprint (Trello?)
